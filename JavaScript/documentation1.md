## What is JS?
a versatile, high-level programming language and one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS

## Where JS?
- In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between `<script>` and `</script>` tags.
- JavaScript in `<head>` or `<body>` (Interpreter or Compiler)
- External JavaScript
- places we can write JS code (window, Browser, Console)

`var` can be updated, can be redeclared, Function Scope 
`const` can't be updated, can't be redeclared, Block Scope

## Identifier 
the name given to a variable, function, class, etc.

## JS Numbers 
- JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric
operations except for addition.
- If one of the operands is a string in a + operation, JavaScript will
perform string concatenation instead of arithmetic addition

## What is NaN?
**Not a Number**
- result of invalid math 
- NaN doesn't equal itself 
`NaN == NaN` : False 

## Number Method 
`toString()` : Converts number to a string.
`toFixed(x)`: Formats number with fixed number of decimals
`isNaN(x)`: Checks if value is the special NaN
`parseInt(x)`: Converts string to integer (stops at first non-digit).
`parseFloat(x)`: Converts string to float preserving decimals
`isInteger(x)`: Checks if value is an integer.


## Operators 
- Arithmetic Operator 
- Assignment Operator 
- Increment/ Decrement
